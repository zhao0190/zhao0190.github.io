When I’m doing this Web Portfolio, I was struggling with the way I should organize the website. Eventually, I found out an easy way by using grid elements and placeholders. Besides that, I was also confused about how to make the website responsive. I learned the hover element throughout this assignment, and it’s very useful in general. The font and images that I used in the web portfolio were by defont and stock images.
